                    &ensp;&ensp;YRC trains to render selfless service to their society. In a bid to prepare communities for emergencies and to nurture humanitarianism in the youth, the Youth Red Cross unit of SJCET undertakes umpteen tasks.

                    &ensp;&ensp;Youth represent a substantial part of the membership of Red Cross for its humanitarian commitment. Young volunteers can make a significant contribution to meeting the needs of the most vulnerable people within their local communities through Red Cross youth programme. This has been designed to involve young people as much as possible in the movement and its activities not only as workers and also as beneficiaries, but as partners in management.
